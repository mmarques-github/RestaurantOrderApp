# restaurant_app_new

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Cybersecurity Risks

- The timestamp of the order must be taken from the server to prevent the user from changing the time of the order.
- If table ordering is implemented, the current idea is to use a randomly generated code to identify the table. This code must be generated by the server to prevent the user from changing the table. This should work like the authenticator apps.
- It seems like some random person could just log into the localhost and change the order status. The localhost should also be password protected.
- No internet no app. The app should be able to work offline within the wifi network.

## Features

- Make app have english and portuguese languages at least on the table side.
- Consider adding a BAR function where it displays the drinks, desert and entree orders separately.


## SQL tables

### User
- id
- name
- type (customer, waiter, chef)

### Order
- id
- table_id  (0 if takeout)
- order_type (table, takeout)
- order_status (pending, preparing, ready, delivered) - this is displayed on a button that can be changed by the chef
- order_time (timestamp)
- delivery_time (timestamp) - this is only filled when the order is delivered
- user_id (waiter id)


### Menu (Usually there are 2 menus daily and a fixed menu)
- id
- name (daily, fixed)
- list of items


### Item
- id
- name
- menu_id
- type (entree, main, dessert, drink)
- user_id (waiter id, chef id)
- availability (available, unavailable)
- additional_info (no salad, no onions, etc) - This should spawn a list of checkboxes on the app. But first implemented in text form.
